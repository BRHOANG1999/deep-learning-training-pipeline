    "# 🧠 Welcome to Deep Learning for Neuroscience! \n",
    "\n",
    "Hello there, future computational neuroscientist! 👋\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to an exciting journey where cutting-edge **deep learning** meets the fascinating world of **brain science**. Whether you're here because you're curious about how neural networks can decode brain signals, or you want to build AI systems inspired by biological intelligence, you're in for a treat!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it: your brain processes information in ways that still mystify scientists. Every time you recognize a face, remember a song, or learn something new, billions of neurons are firing in complex patterns. What if we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decode** those patterns to help paralyzed patients control robotic arms? \n",
    "- **Predict** epileptic seizures before they happen?\n",
    "- **Understand** how different brain states relate to consciousness, attention, and decision-making?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the power of applying deep learning to neuroscience data! And the best part? You already have the CS foundation to make this happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes This Different? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional machine learning on images or text, neuroscience data comes with unique challenges:\n",
    "- **Time matters**: Brain signals evolve over milliseconds\n",
    "- **Noise is everywhere**: Biology is messy!\n",
    "- **Small datasets**: We can't exactly ask someone to have 10,000 seizures for our training set\n",
    "- **Interpretability is crucial**: We need to understand *why* our model works, not just *that* it works\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will teach you to navigate these challenges while building genuinely useful tools for understanding the brain.\n",
